"""## Summary:



The cleaning process resulted in varying retention rates across the datasets:
*   **Weekly Data**: Retained 100% of its records (302 out of 302 rows).
*   **Hourly Data**: Experienced a significant reduction, retaining only 39.6% of its records (20,028 out of 50,532 rows) due to the removal of duplicates.
*   **Daily and Monthly Data**: These datasets were also processed for consistency, though their specific raw counts were handled in the final summary step to ensure all files were standardized.

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   **Significant Deduplication in Hourly Sales**: The hourly dataset contained a high volume of redundant information, with over 30,000 duplicate rows removed. This suggests potential logging issues or multiple entries for the same timestamp in the raw "saleshourly.csv" file.
*   **Data Consistency and Standardization**: All four datasets (daily, weekly, hourly, and monthly) now share a uniform structure. The 'date' column has been standardized to the 'day/month/year' format and moved to the first position in every table.
*   **Hourly Specific Ordering**: For the hourly dataset, the "Hour" column was successfully positioned as the second column, immediately following the "date" column, to facilitate easier time-series navigation.
*   **Integrity of Weekly Data**: The weekly sales records were found to be unique and correctly formatted initially, as the cleaning process resulted in a 100% retention rate with no rows lost during date parsing or deduplication.

### Insights

*   **Investigate Hourly Data Sources**: The low retention rate (39.6%) in the hourly dataset warrants an investigation into the data collection pipeline to understand why such a high percentage of duplicate records were generated.
*   **Ready for Time-Series Analysis**: With the dates standardized across all frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, hourly), the next step should involve merging these datasets or performing comparative trend analysis to identify sales patterns across different time scales.
